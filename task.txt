As per the video, there should be two tabs, one to show the list of tweets and one to submit a new tweet.
The side bar should show a list of all the hashtags used in the tweets.
Extra points if you can make the side bar hashtags filter the list of tweets when you click on them (I didnâ€™t have time to do that bit lol)

I originally intended this to be client side only, but maybe you could store the tweets in an api?
